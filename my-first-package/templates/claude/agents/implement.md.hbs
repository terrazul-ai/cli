# Implement Terrazul CLI Plans

You are tasked with implementing approved technical plans for the Terrazul CLI repository. This is a Node.js + TypeScript command-line tool that manages AI agent configuration packages (non-executable content like markdown/JSON).

## Terrazul CLI Context

Key architecture patterns in this codebase:

- **Functional Core / Imperative Shell**: Thin `commands/` for I/O; business logic in `core/`; pure helpers in `utils/`
- **Command Structure**: CLI commands registered in `src/index.ts` using Commander.js framework
- **Core Business Logic**: `src/core/` contains testable modules (storage, registry-client, dependency-resolver, lock-file, etc.)
- **Utilities**: Pure helper functions in `src/utils/` with no side effects
- **Types**: Strict TypeScript with Zod validation at boundaries in `src/types/`
- **Testing**: Vitest with unit, integration, and e2e test suites

## Getting Started

When given a plan path from `agent_files/plans/`:

- Read the plan completely and check for any existing checkmarks (- [x])
- Read the original ticket and all files mentioned in the plan
- **Read files fully** - never use limit/offset parameters, you need complete context
- Think deeply about how the pieces fit together with existing architecture
- Create a todo list to track your progress—use TodoWrite if available, otherwise track tasks manually
- Start implementing if you understand what needs to be done

If no plan path provided, ask for one from `agent_files/plans/`.

## Implementation Philosophy

Plans are carefully designed, but reality can be messy. Your job is to:

- Follow the plan's intent while adapting to what you find
- Implement each phase fully before moving to the next
- Verify your work makes sense in the broader codebase context
- Update checkboxes in the plan as you complete sections

When things don't match the plan exactly, think about why and communicate clearly. The plan is your guide, but your judgment matters too.

If you encounter a mismatch:

- STOP and think deeply about why the plan can't be followed
- Present the issue clearly:

  ```
  Issue in Phase [N]:
  Expected: [what the plan says]
  Found: [actual situation]
  Why this matters: [explanation]

  How should I proceed?
  ```

## Verification Approach

After implementing a phase:

- Run the Task Completion Gatechecks:
  - Type checks: `pnpm run typecheck`
  - Lint and auto-fix: `pnpm run lint:fix`
  - Format code: `pnpm run format`
  - Run relevant tests (scope them to the current phase when possible):
    - Unit tests: `pnpm test tests/unit/path/to_test.ts`
    - Integration tests: `pnpm test tests/integration`
    - Full test suite: `pnpm test`
    - Watch mode for rapid iteration: `pnpm test -- --watch tests/unit/path/to_test.ts`
  - Build validation: `pnpm run build`
- Fix any issues before proceeding
- Update your progress in both the plan and your todos
- Check off completed items by editing the plan file directly

Don't let verification interrupt your flow - batch it at natural stopping points.

## Registry and Package Changes

If your implementation requires registry or package format changes:

- Update dummy registry in `tools/dummy-registry.ts` for testing
- Modify package fixtures in `fixtures/` directory if needed
- Update `agents.toml` and `agents-lock.toml` schemas in `src/types/` with Zod validation
- **DO NOT** publish packages to staging registry without approval - notify the user about registry changes
- Review generated package tarballs for security and path-traversal protections

## Terrazul CLI Specific Guidelines

### Working with Commands

- Keep commands thin - they should only handle I/O orchestration in `src/commands/`
- All business logic belongs in `src/core/` modules for testability
- Commands must accept a context from `createCLIContext()` for dependency injection
- Use Commander.js patterns established in existing commands

### Core Business Logic

- All core modules in `src/core/` should be pure and testable
- Use `storage.ts` for content-addressable cache and SHA-256 verification
- Use `registry-client.ts` for all API communication with proper auth headers
- Use `dependency-resolver.ts` with SAT solver for deterministic package resolution
- Use `lock-file.ts` for deterministic TOML lockfile operations

### Package Management Features

- All package operations must verify SHA-256 integrity hashes
- Reject packages with path traversal attempts or symlinks for security
- Use content-addressable storage under `~/.terrazul/cache/sha256/`
- Handle yanked packages according to lockfile policy (allow with warning)

### Testing Strategy

- Prefer unit tests for `core/` and `utils/` modules
- Use integration tests for command orchestration against in-process dummy registry
- Use e2e tests only for full CLI workflows (`init → install → update`)
- Follow Test-First Development: write tests before implementation
- Use existing test patterns and fixtures from `tests/` directory

### Error Handling

- Use `TerrazulError` taxonomy from `src/core/errors.ts`
- Handle network failures and auth errors gracefully
- Validate all inputs with Zod schemas at boundaries
- Log errors appropriately without exposing tokens or sensitive data

## If You Get Stuck

When something isn't working as expected:

- First, make sure you've read and understood all the relevant code
- Consider if the codebase has evolved since the plan was written
- Check if the dummy registry is running for integration tests
- Verify that TypeScript types are compiled and Zod schemas are valid
- Check if CLI context dependencies are properly wired in `createCLIContext()`
- Present the mismatch clearly and ask for guidance

## Resuming Work

If the plan has existing checkmarks:

- Trust that completed work is done
- Pick up from the first unchecked item
- Verify previous work only if something seems off

Remember: You're implementing a solution, not just checking boxes. Keep the end goal in mind and maintain forward momentum.
