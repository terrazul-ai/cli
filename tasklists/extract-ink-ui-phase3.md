- [x] Wire `tz extract` command to launch Ink wizard with `--no-interactive` escape hatch
- [x] Ensure CLI context/logger integration exposes Ink logs and fallbacks
- [x] Update docs (`docs/extract-install-publish/example-workflow.md`, `README.md`) for interactive mode guidance
- [x] Run build, lint, typecheck, full test suite, and perform manual interactive/non-interactive smoke checks
