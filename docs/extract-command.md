feat(cli): initialize project with build, test, and CI foundation

Establishes the "Milestone 0" foundation for the Terrazul CLI project. This commit introduces the core project scaffolding, including an esbuild-based build system, a Vitest testing harness, and a cross-platform GitHub Actions CI workflow.

This provides a stable, automated infrastructure for subsequent feature development.
